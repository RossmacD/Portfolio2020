Shcoop was a project developed with React Native, socketIO, node and mongoDB.

Over the course of 2 months a team of 5 including myself developed an Android, iOS and web application. We created a party game which was played in realtime nad could be played with players on any device. I worked on every aspect of this project but was responsible for the networking code and for a large part of the backend.
